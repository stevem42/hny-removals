          <p class="terms-bold">6 CLAIMS ON GOODS:</p>
          <p>
            H&Y accepts full responsibility for any damage to goods in their
            care or caused by their sub-contractors. In the event damage is done
            to furniture items by the contractors and/or sub-contractors and
            immediately reported to H&Y head office, the customer will be
            instructed to pay the bill for the service before the claim of
            damage furniture will rectified. Once the bill is paid in full for
            the rendered service, the customer will be instructed to get a quote
            from the company of their choosing to fix the damaged item in
            question. If the customer refuses to pay any portion of the bill for
            whatever reason given by the customer, no items of damage done by
            the contractor or sub-contractors will commence until the bill is
            paid totally in full to H&Y. Once the bill is paid in full for the
            removal service the customer can instruct the company of their
            choosing to email the quote of the cost to fix the damage item in
            question to hy********@*****.com to the attn of the General Mgr.
            Then H&Y will contact the company of the customer's choosing and pay
            the quote directly to the company, there will be no discounts on the
            cost of the actual move, nor refunds from the total bill of the
            service rendered. The company can then proceed to fix the damage
            item of furniture to the customers liking and return the item to the
            customer resolving the issue in full of the damage item. If the item
            in question is not done to the satisfaction of the customer, it will
            be the responsibility of the customer to sort that out with the
            company they choose to fix the item in question. Once H&Y has paid
            the original quote, it will not pay any more funds except the amount
            of the original quote received, to further fix the item in question
            that was not done to the customer's liking as they choose the
            craftsmanship of the company of their choosing to fix the damaged
            furniture item in question, Policy terms and conditions apply
